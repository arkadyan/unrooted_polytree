# UnrootedPolytree

A data type and related functions to support an unrooted (multiple starting nodes) polytree (a tree-like graph with edges).

Pictoral example:

                \            ˄
                ˅          /
      O--->O--->O--->O--->O--->O--->O--->O
                            \
                            ˅
                            O
